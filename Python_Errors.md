## Vanilla Python

Some of these errors can be easily seen in your python IDE by running code after the ```>>>```. Activate your IDE by entering ```python``` in your terminal.

-----------------------

## Syntax Error

* You are missing or have an extranious character somewhere. Most often it is a missing colon after an if statement or loop. Test often to catch these errors quickly.

* See it happen: ```>>> for x in range(10)```

```python
# code looking something like this
for x in range(10)
	print x 
	
# error you get
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

## Indentation Error

* You either forgot to indent some code, or you indented a line that should not be indented. This often happend when the code in a function declaration or for loop is not indented. 

##### Expected Indentation

```python
# code looking something like this
def myFunc():
print "in myFunc"
return True

# error you get
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

##### Unexpected Indentation

```python
# code looking something like this
def myFunc():
	print "in myFunc"
		return True

# error you get
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```


## Key Error

* You are trying to access a value in a dictionary by a key that doesn't exist. To avoid this error, you can validate that there is a specific key before trying to access it.

* See it happen: ``` >>> {}['someKey'] ```

```python
# code looking something like this
someVar = myDictionary['someKey']

# error you get
KeyError: 'someKey'
```

##### Solution:

```python
# validate the key exists
if 'someKey' in myDictionary:
	someVar = myDictionary['someKey']
# handel error appropriately
else:
	someVar = 0
```

## Attribute Error

* You are assuming some variable is an object when it is actually some other type. This often happens when a function returns ```None``` do to the absence of a return statement but you are expecting an object.

* See it happen: ``` >>> None.someAttr ```

```python
# code looking something like this
assumedObject = myFunction()
someVar = assumedObject.someAttr

# error you get
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'someAttr'
```

##### Solution:

```python
# validate variable is an object
if isinstance(assumedObject, dict):
	someVar = assumedObject.someAttr
# handel error appropriately
else:
	someVar = 0
```
